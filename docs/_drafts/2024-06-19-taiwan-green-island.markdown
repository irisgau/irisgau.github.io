Green Island (綠島, pinyin: Lǜ dǎo), also known as Ludao or Lyudao, is a hidden gem off the coast of Taiwan. I had a chance to visit while I was living in Taipei, and was amazed by its natural landscapes and the warm hospitability I experienced. It was a side to Taiwan completely unlike the main island, and I highly recommend a visit. I planned this trip just a couple weeks prior, with a friend I had met through a scholarship program. Here's a recap of my 3 days on the island!

# Day 1: Arrival in Taitung

* Transit: Like all transit in Taiwan, the journey from Taipei Main Station to Taitung was as convenient as ever. The train ride took about 4.5 hours, but went by fast.
* Stay: We splurged on a nicer stay at the [Gaya Hotel](https://www.gaya-hotels.com/en/), which had a great deal on Agoda ($130.75 for one night, split between two).
* Exploring Taitung: After settling in, we walked to Haibin Park, a rocky beach. Taitung felt more like a driving or scootering city, as we hardly saw any other pedestrians on the 20 minute walk there. 
* Dinner: Delicious noodles from [老東台米台目](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8WGbUMY9b5W1M9go8).
* Night swim: I booked this hotel romanticizing an evening dip, and it did not disappoint. The rooftop infinity pool made for a perfect and relaxing night swim.

# Day 2: Half Day on Green Island
* Breakfast: The Gaya Hotel breakfast was amazing, with a variety of western and eastern options.
* Journey to Green Island: We took a taxi to Fugang Harbor, chatting with our friendly driver about life in Taitung. The ferry ride was a bit intimidating with its seasick-preparedness (lots of vomit bags), but thankfully I slept through most of it.
* Arriving at Nan Liao Harbour: We arrived around 11am. The owners of our hotel picked us up and guided us through renting scooters. This was the biggest unknown when planning the trip, unsure how it'd work without an international license -- it turns out we could rent electric scooters, which were easy and safe to ride.
* Check-in: We checked into [Hai Yin Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bY8DsCUmwovFhLc48) (which translates to "ocean sound"), where the 老闆娘 (lǎo bǎn niáng = female boss, or boss's wife) walked us through the island's landmarks.
* Exploring: By the time we headed out, it was around noon. We practiced a bit on the scooters, before stopping at landmarks like Niutoushan (Cow Head Mountain) and the White Terror Memorial Park. This is a whole other topic to go into, but essentially it used to be a prison for political prisoners.
* Lunch: This is where we learned that most restaurants are closed between meals on the island. We still managed to eat some yummy pasta at [富富廚房fufukitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jhh82QMVUTUcLUhTA).
* A serene dip: We took in the ocean views from the lighthouse and swam in Wuyouku 烏油窟, a natural little swimming spot.
* Snorkeling: We joined a guided snorkel tour in the afternoon, which we booked that morning through the hotel. It was different from other experiences I had in the US -- the snorkel areas here are quite rocky, so it's recommended to go with a guided tour. We met at the shop, changed into wetsuits, and all rode to Chaikou Snorkeling Area.
* Dinner: We enjoyed a seafood meal at [林家麵飯小吃](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L1fieGTgtr14Rdt27) followed by mango shaved ice at [憲冰隊](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V35JPR97HRnbjkXy6 ). Oddly, the island has several jail-themed dessert shops due to the presence of an active jail on the island (different than the White Terror historical prison).
* Stargazing: At night, we rode up to the hill above Zhaori Hot Springs to stargaze. Even with the full moon, we saw more stars than I'd ever seen in my life. It was breathtaking. The scooter ride back, with the cool breeze and sound of the ocean, felt like something out of a movie.

# Day 3: Full Day on Green Island
* Breakfast: We kicked off the day with Taiwanese breakfast sandwiches at [小阿姨早餐店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qGGj7t9gYfahUsS36 ).
* Blue Cave: We went on another guided snorkel, this time to the Blue Cave, a mesmerizing spot with vibrant, blue waters.
* Circling the island: After beef noodle soup at [阿牛牛肉麵](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LyagtMZb3u64DkcPA), we circled the island on our scooters, stopping at natural formations like Sleeping Beauty Rock and her neighbor, Pekingese Dog Rock. The view from Little Great Wall was amazing. The ride around the island was so much fun, and took about an hour.
* Beach: At Da Bai Sha 大白沙, a white sand beach, we happened to run into one of the hotel workers and had a lovely chat. He's a young guy who just started working at the hotel to experience some change, and push himself to meet new people.
* Sunset: We returned to the lighthouse and watched a beautiful sunset.
* Dinner: Dinner was Korean takeout from [綠島AJS韓式炸雞店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zYJWJwEs6CWpQ6q37), which we brought back to the hotel to enjoy.
* Hot Springs: We ended the day with a soak in the Zhaori Hot Springs, which is prided as one of the three salt water springs on earth.
* Night cap: Another round of mango shaved ice, this time from [綠島大街冰館](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xKzaXsXvad98SFCZ7). This strip of restaurants and dessert shops was conveniently walking distance from our hotel.

# Day 4: Return to Taipei
* Last morning: Took a final spin on the scooter before packing up and heading to the harbor.
* Return to Taipei: The ferry took us back to Taitung, where we caught a taxi to the train station. While waiting for the train, we grabbed a quick bento at [悟饕池上飯包](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QVFLFGWxRmWz1vft9 ). Soon enough, we were back in Taipei.

# Travel Tips
* Meals: Restaurants on Green Island are small and family-run, so they often close between meals. Make sure to grab lunch and dinner during regular meal hours. Google Maps is often not accurate for open hours.
* Scooter rentals: If you don’t have a motorcycle/scooter license, don’t worry! You can still rent lightweight e-scooters, which are easy to ride and perfect for exploring the island.
* Wear your helmet! Police were actively fining people (mostly locals) riding motorcycles/scooters without one.

# Transportation
#### Taitung
* We took the Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei Train Station to Taitung Train Station. The ride was approximately 4.5 hours.
* Since we were only here for one evening, walking worked for us. However, to properly explore Taitung, you definitely need a vehicle. For a longer stay in Taitung without a car or scooter, I would consider [Taiwan Trip Bus Tour](https://www.taiwantrip.com.tw/Frontend/Bustime/TimeTable/R0073).


#### Green Island
* Ferry: 
  * I booked my round-trip ferry ticket on [Klook](https://www.klook.com/en-US/activity/11080-green-island-round-trip-ferry-tickets-taitung/). I did not choose the additional options. The ride was approximately 1 hour.
  * We were warned in advance of seasickness on the boat ride (varying with weather) and were encouraged to take seasickness pills before the ride. While I usually don't get seasick, I took the medication just in case, and had no issues. An alternate route is flying.
* Transportation on the island:
  * There are no car rentals and buses on the small island so this is the way to go.
  * While you can book on your own, most accomodations will help you book your scooter rental. 
  * As mentioned previously, lightweight e-scooters are available to rent, even without a scooter or international license. We were not allowed to rent a two-person electric scooter and definitely not a motorcycle. It actually felt safer to have individual scooters. 
  * It was difficult to get information on this before the trip, but I believe there's a legal limit of 25kph for non-licensed two-wheelers, which is how we can still ride an e-scooter, that's just capped at 25kph.

* We communicated mainly in Chinese, and she said she uses Google translate when communicating with non-Mandarin speakers.

This was such an amazing trip, and the perfect way to close out my time living abroad in Taiwan. We almost didn't want to leave.
