Green Island (綠島, pinyin: Lǜ dǎo), also known as Ludao or Lyudao, is a hidden gem off the coast of Taiwan. I had a chance to visit while I was living in Taipei, and was amazed by its natural landscapes and the warm hospitability I experienced. It was a side to Taiwan completely unlike the main island, and I highly recommend a visit. Here's a recap of my 3 days on the island!

# Day 1: Arrival in Taitung

* Transit: Took a train from Taipei Main Station to Taitung, the ride was a little over 4 hours long but went by fast.
* Stay: We splurged on a nice stay at the [Gaya Hotel](https://www.gaya-hotels.com/en/), which had a great deal on agoda.com ($130.75 for one night, split between two).
* Exploring Taitung: After settling in, we walked to Haibin Park, a rocky beach. Taitung felt more like a driving or scootering city, as we hardly saw any other pedestrians. Dinner was a highlight at [老東台米台目](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8WGbUMY9b5W1M9go8), a delicious noodle shop.
* Night swim: Ended the day with a serene night swim in the infinity pool at the hotel.

# Day 2: Half Day on Green Island
* Breakfast: The Gaya Hotel breakfast was amazing, with a variety of options.
* Journey to Green Island: We took a taxi to Fugang Harbor, chatting with our friendly driver about life in Taitung. The ferry ride was a bit intimidating with its seasick-preparedness (lots of vomit bags), but thankfully I slept through most of it.
* Arriving at Nan Liao Harbour: The owners of Hai Yin Hotel picked us up and guided us through renting scooters. Initially worried about renting a 2-person scooter, we opted for e-bikes, which were surprisingly easy to ride.
* Exploring the Island: We checked into [Hai Yin Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bY8DsCUmwovFhLc48) (which translates to "Ocean Sound), where the lovely owners shared island tips with us. After settling in, we rode the scooters through lush, green landscapes, stopping at landmarks like Niutoushan (Cow Head Mountain) and the Green Island White Terror Memorial Park.
* Snorkeling adventure: We joined a guided snorkel tour in the afternoon. It was different from my experience in Hawaii, as the waters were rockier and more suited to guided tours. We met at the shop, changed into wetsuits, and all rode to Chaikou Snorkeling Area.
* Dinner: We enjoyed a hearty meal at [林家麵飯小吃](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L1fieGTgtr14Rdt27) followed by mango shaved ice at [憲冰隊](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V35JPR97HRnbjkXy6 ). Oddly enough, the island has several jail-themed dessert shops due to the presence of a jail on the island.
* Stargazing: At night, we rode up to Zhaori Hot Springs to catch the stunning full moon and starry sky. It was breathtaking, and the cool scooter ride back felt like something out of a movie.

# Day 3: Full Day on Green Island
* Breakfast: We kicked off the day with Taiwanese breakfast sandwiches at [小阿姨早餐店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qGGj7t9gYfahUsS36 ).
* Blue Cave Snorkeling: We went on another guided snorkel, this time to the Blue Cave, a mesmerizing spot filled with marine life.
* Exploring More: After lunch at [阿牛牛肉麵](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LyagtMZb3u64DkcPA), we circled the island on our scooters, stopping at natural formations like Sleeping Beauty Rock, Pekingese Dog Rock, and Da Bai Sha (a white sand beach). 
* Sunset: We made it back to the lighthouse to watch the sunset.
* Dinner: Dinner was Korean takeout from [綠島AJS韓式炸雞店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zYJWJwEs6CWpQ6q37), which we brought back to the hotel to enjoy.
* Hot Springs: We ended the day with a soak in the Zhaori Hot Springs, which is prided as one of the three salt water springs on earth.
* Night cap: Another round of mango shaved ice, this time from [綠島大街冰館](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xKzaXsXvad98SFCZ7).

# Day 4: Return to Taipei
* Last Morning Spin: Took a final scooter ride around the island before heading back.
* Return to Taipei: The ferry took us back to Taitung, where we caught a taxi to the train station. While waiting for the train, we grabbed a quick bento meal at [悟饕池上飯包](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QVFLFGWxRmWz1vft9 ). After a scenic train ride, we were back in Taipei.

# Travel Tips
* Plan your meals: Many restaurants on Green Island are family-run, so they often close between meals. Make sure to eat lunch and dinner before they shut down.
* Scooter rentals: If you don’t have a scooter license, don’t worry! E-bikes are easy to ride and perfect for exploring the island.

This was such an amazing trip, and the perfect way to close out my time living abroad in Taiwan. We almost didn't want to leave.
