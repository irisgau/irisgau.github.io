When I first decided to foster cats, I thought I’d be giving them a chance at a better life. What I didn’t realize was how much they’d teach me in return about trust, patience, and resilience. Here’s what I’ve learned along the way.

# Trust
Earning the trust of an animal is one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve ever had. Each animal is different and shaped by their unique past. Cissy, my first foster, had been through multiple homes, her last owner having passed away. Despite her journey, she trusted me almost immediately.

Millie took more time. She came to me depressed after giving birth in a foster home, being separated from her kittens, and returned to the shelter. She was scared and skittish, but slowly her trust grew until she was inseparable from me.

Then there's Frodo, my current foster: a feral kitten who spent most of his life in the shelter and was terrified of humans. Every day I sat quietly with him for hours. And every day, he hissed at me. The first time he sat in my lap 5 weeks later, I teared up. Moments like this reminded me that trust is something earned.

# Patience
I’ve never thought of myself as a particularly patient person, but fostering has taught me patience in ways unimaginable. Frodo recently had an incident with a dingleberry that smeared poop across the carpet... like literally, everywhere. I spent forever scrubbing it clean, but I wasn’t angry with him. I understood it wasn’t his fault.

Cats live with pure intentions. When they knock something over, I know it's not out of malice — it's simply instinct. They’re not out to frustrate you (well, usually); they just want to feel safe, loved, and cared for. This understanding of their innocence has helped me approach not just animals, but people, with more patience and empathy. Fostering has challenged me to let go of frustrations and focus on the small steps forward.

# Resilience
Frodo was unsocialized and scared of everything. Millie had been separated from her kittens, then returned to the shelter. And then there was Cissy.

Cissy had been through multiple homes before her last owner passed away, leaving her overweight, arthritic, and with a bacterial infection that required a daily butt wiping. But over time, she grew more comfortable, her infection improved, and her mobility increased.

Through love and care, each of these cats blossomed. Despite everything they had been through, they held no grudges. They adapted, grew, and became the best versions of themselves.


# Bravery 
I see Frodo’s bravery grow, little by little, every day. This is a cat who used to bolt at the sound of me shifting. Yet today - the moment that prompted me to reflect and write these thoughts down - he stayed calm amidst deafening construction noises, looking to me for reassurance. I teared up again.

At first, he’d hide whenever I wasn’t in the room, but my presence gave him courage. He started by staying close to me, gradually building up the confidence to explore on his own. Watching him overcome his fears reminded me of the importance of creating a safe space.

I've also seen the impact of positive reinforcement. Frodo responds to every small reward — pets, treats, gentle words. Each time he faces his fears, I celebrate his bravery, and over time, his confidence has grown. It’s a simple lesson: encouragement can change lives, whether it’s for animals or people.


# Cherishing What I’ve Gained
Saying goodbye is the hardest part of fostering. When I found forever homes for Cissy and Millie, it broke my heart a little. I had grown to love them deeply.

But fostering isn’t about holding on — it’s about creating spaces for animals to thrive. By transitioning them to their new owners, I opened up space to foster more cats in need. While it’s bittersweet, I’ll always treasure the memories, and it’s incredibly fulfilling to see them flourish in their forever homes.

# A Better Version of Me
Fostering cats has made me a more patient, positive, and empathetic person. It’s helped me find the good in all things.

Through fostering, I’ve experienced a love that goes beyond words and species. Frodo, Millie, and Cissy have taught me about trust, patience, resilience, and kindness. With the right care and environment, any living being has the potential to thrive. These lessons reach far beyond animals — they extend to people, children, and relationships.

If you’re thinking about fostering, I can’t recommend it enough. It won't just change an animal's life; it will also transform your own.

# Cissy
Cissy was the first cat I fostered and will always hold a special place in my heart. 

Cissy came to me in rough shape. She was stinky, unable to groom herself, and had a host of issues: arthritis, obesity, and a bacterial infection. But as the days passed, she got better. Her fur grew back, her energy returned, and she cracked me up with her personality. 

I was moved seeing someone else recognize the love Cissy had to give. Her adopter looked past her initial challenges and welcomed her into a forever home, reminding me of the goodness and compassion people are capable of.

Even through her physical challenges, Cissy brought joy to every moment. She showed me that every living being, no matter their struggles, deserves a chance to thrive.

Through Cissy, I discovered the world of fostering, and she gave nothing but unconditional love until her passing in December 2023. Thank you, Cissy, for everything. :')
