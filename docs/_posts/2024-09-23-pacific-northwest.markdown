# Seattle (5 days): Food, Friends, and Adventure

**Friday:**
* Arrival: After landing, I immediately noticed the diversity of the people and languages I heard at the airport. An easy and affordable 40 minute ride later via the link light rail, I was already in the city center.
* Dinner at [Ginger & Scallion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qcgmcxf2Dfg27Pvr6): Shortly after meeting with my friend and her husband who were hosting me, we went to Ginger & Scallion for hainanese chicken rice. Cucumber salad was skippable (good but nothing special), chicken wings were delicious, and chicken rice definitely the star of the show.

**Saturday:**
* Dimsum at [Harbor City Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XzMyyi9RqqnMnx2R8): Classic dim sum experience, the perfect start to the day.
* REI: Bought some gear for our upcoming hike. The REI flagship store was huge and quite beautiful.
* Catch-up: Met up with my former coworker and his family at an indoor kids' playground, then grabbed a quick dinner at [Café Hagen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oZLkCwTYP3EwZ3rH8). It was lovely to meet his family for the first time, despite working together remotely several years through the pandemic.
* [Swing Dance Class](https://www.swingdancesct.com/) in Fremont: Took a fun swing dance class in Fremont in the evening.

**Sunday: Hiking Day at Mt. Rainier**
* Early Start: Left for Mt. Rainier at 6am and got there with no line for cars entering the park, which my friends said they had endured the last time they went.
* Hike: Hiked part of the Skyline loop and returned via the Alta Vista trail, covering around 5-6 miles. The Alta Vista trail was our favorite part. Absolutely beautiful.
* Lunch: My friend packed ramen and hot water for a post-hike meal. It was so delicious but my weak spice tolerance led me to buying a chili dog at the visitor center. 10/10.
* Dinner: Had delicious Seolleongtang (ox bone soup) at [Yi's Traditional Korean Beef Soup](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ds2mMQ3x1eib6ZRc7) to end the day.

**Monday: Classic Tourist Day**
* Pike Place Market: Walked around the market and window-shopped in the area.
* Bill Speidel's Underground Tour: Fun and educational. Learned about the history of Seattle and the structure of the city - it's built one level up after a long history of flooding.
* Dinner: Met with an old friend who I interned with, who shared about his experience in Seattle for the past several years. Walking around downtown in the evening felt safer than I expected.

**Tuesday: Neighborhood Hopping**
* Queen Anne: Stopped by Kerrie Park for an amazing view of the city and Mt. Rainier in the background. I had no idea actually before now, how the mountain towered over the city.
* Fremont: Wandered around, making stops at Wonderland Gear Exchange and Fremont Vintage Mall.
* Green Lake: Took a bus there just as school let out. It kind of warmed my heart to see the diversity of middle schoolers on board.
* Dinner: Had an incredible meal at [Kedai Makan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7YYo4RdN3yhEkKgo8) in Capitol Hill, and a wonderful catch-up with a college friend. The creamy vegan coconut milkshake is a must.

**Wednesday: Ferry Ride to Victoria**
* Morning Ferry: Took an 8am [Clipper](https://www.clippervacations.com/) ferry, which was easy to get to from the city. I basically just fell asleep the whole 3 hours.

***Public Transit***
* I initially downloaded the "Transit Go" app to buy a mobile ticket for the link light rail. It was good I did, because I completely missed where to tap my orca card before boarding the train, and transit workers later checked for tickets. 
* I also got an Orca card in case there were issues with the app. Later I switched to using the "Orca" app alongside my card, because you can get a $6 day pass to ride any transit in the city. "Transit Go" does not allow you to buy a day pass that works across different transit modes (bus, light rail, etc.)

# Victoria (2 days): Gardens, Museums, and City Charm

**Wednesday: Arrival in Victoria**
* Immigration: A negative encounter with the officer who managed to mansplain me on the "dangers" of staying in a hostel and questioned how I could financially sustain this trip, but I made it through.
* Uber to Hostel: Chose Uber over the bus after the officier told me I was going to "the most dangerous part of the city", but had a lovely driver who assured me I was going to be safe. Also, the area was totally fine. Houseless people were simply trying to exist nearby.
* Explored the area: Checked out thrift shops around [Ocean Island Hostel](https://www.oceanisland.com/) and snagged some good finds.
* Walk to Inner Harbour: Strolled through the scenic inner harbor and walked around the Legislative Assembly, where there are guided tours and self-tours.
* Beacon Hill Park: Strolled around the park and saw a random peacock.
* Chinatown: Historical buildings and many cute shops.
* Hostel Dinner: Enjoyed dinner at the hostel and had a nice chat with a traveler from Calgary named Owen. We talked about Canadian and American cities and urban planning.

**Thursday: A Full Day in Victoria**
* Butchart Gardens: I took an hour long bus directly from the hostel to the gardens. It was an easy and convenient bus ride. The gardens were absolutely stunning. I spent several hours here and had lunch at the coffee shop within the gates.
* Royal BC Museum: A security guard named Sam gave me a personal little tour of his favorite parts of the Old Town exhibit. He is originally from Venezuala and shared with me that he just received his permanent residency, after living in Canada for 5 years. Interactions like this make me believe in humanity.
* Evening Vibes: Caught live music, had poutine from a food truck, and walked around the downtown area, taking in the lights of the Legislative Building. The man at the food truck gave me an extra serving after finding out it was my first time in Canada and eating poutine. I'm officially on team poutine.

**Friday: Goodbye Victoria**
* Morning: Grabbed a sandwich near the hostel at [Macchiato Caffe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FghQJe95Qavvs53y7) which was SO good.
* Bus ride: Caught the 70 bus to ride one hour up north to the Swartz Ferry terminal. Not the most comfortable ride with luggage, as basically everyone going to the ferry is riding this bus, but it worked.
* Ferry Ride: Off to Vancouver!

***Public Transit***
* The city doesn't use physical transit cards. Rather, they use an app called "Umo". You must load at least $5 at a time, which is a bit of poor design for short trips.
* You scan the app QR code when you enter a bus. Generally it worked well, but one time was not able to scan for me and others behind me. The bus driver was kind and let us on anyways. 
* Very easy to get to Butchart Garden via the 75 bus, ~45 minute ride.
* Very easy to get to Swartz Ferry via the 70 bus, ~1 hour ride.

***Accomodations***
* I stayed at [Ocean Island Hostel](https://www.oceanisland.com/) in a private double room. Hotels were out of my budge and Airbnbs were outside of the walkable downtown area.
* I have stayed in hostels all over Europe and Asia, though this was my first in North America. I think they are a great, affordable option, of course with tradeoffs. I recommend always reading reviews on aspects that matter most to you (cleanliness, sound, etc.)
* Some initial concerns on the safety of the area, but I had no problem and felt safe. Note that I am someone who has lived in major cities, and believes that homeless communities in the area does not equate directly to danger. Of course I was still mindful, especially after dark.
* It's an older building with little sound insulation, but I had no problem sleeping with earplugs.
* The hostel includes a simple breakfast and dinner. The dinners had 2 options each time, such as chili, dahl, and chickpea curry. It was simple and yummy!
* There were many different ages of people which I loved seeing.

# Vancouver (4 days): Foodie Paradise and Outdoor Fun

**Friday: Travel Day**
* Transit: The journey from Victoria to Vancouver took about ~6 hours in total via public transit including wait time, but was very smooth and affordable. Read more below in "public transit" section.
  * 1 hr bus from hostel to victoria ferry → 
  * 1 hr wait at ferry because one of their boats was out of service →
  * 1.5 hr ferry ride →
  * 1 hr bus with traffic from vancouver ferry terminal to metro station (should have been 35 min) →
  * 20 min metro to get into city center →
  * 15 min walk to final destination
* I was in no rush and I don't mind idly waiting, in favor of utilizing public transit, so this was no problem for me. However, the bus ride from the ferry into the city was very squished with everyone's suitcases on board.
* Dinner: After meeting up with my friend who hosted me, we ate at [Tozen Sushi Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x94N72Cw9fdiEsM78), which had possibly the best sushi I’ve ever had in North America. Every dish was perfection. My favorite was the salmon aburi hako and creamy udon.

**Saturday: Exploring Granville Island**
* Brunch at [Yolks](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ij7wsTWhbTe5MUpi8): A perfect start to the day.
* Granville Island: Shopped at the public market. I don't have a sweet tooth, but donuts from [Lee's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uos31LhRCMqoAkuZ6) were pretty darn good.
* Robson Street: Window shopped along one of Vancouver’s most famous streets with vintage shops, k-pop merch, and the world's largest Aritzia.
* Dinner: Tsukemen at [Menya ITTO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SDi1LXYUAeNtWxNw6) was rich and delicious. I've had a hard time finding Tsukemen in the bay area, and was so happy with this meal.

**Sunday: Biking Stanley Park**
* Bike Ride: A beautiful ride around Stanley Park. The views were breathtaking. Hands down one of my favorite parts of the trip! Took a couple hours to slowly make our way around the park, with several stops. I did not ride bikes as a kid, so I was a bit nervous, but the bike path was wide and flat.
* Dinner: Wrapped up the day with Korean food at [Sura](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D3GrbXPeeSURRmdD8) — delicious galbi tang.
* Downtown: Helped my friend browse furniture downtown, and thrifted at [Value Village Boutique](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eQeDV8h4vW4hKpG68) which had a huge selection.

**Monday: Last Day in Vancouver**
* Breakfast at [DALINA Broadway](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KU56CKGwDpN5V1d86): A relaxing and slow start with a breakfast wrap and turmeric elixir.
* Hadden Park: Took a walk along the waterfront.
* Museum of Vancouver: Learned about the city's history and culture.
* Lunch: Had a Montreal smoked meat bagel sandwich at [Siegel’s Bagels](https://maps.app.goo.gl/drNuCJyR37ue9Sh59) - nothing super special, but delicious!
* Kitsilano Beach Park: Finished the trip with a peaceful walk along the beach before heading to the airport.

**Public Transit**
* By far the easiest transit system of the whole trip. You can get a Compass Card, or simply use any tap payment option (Apple Pay, credit card, etc.)
* Transit from Twassawen Ferry terminal into the city was a short journey:
  * 35 minute bus ride via the 620 (Bridgeport Express) to Bridgeport Station. However, traffic made this closer to an hour.
  * 20 minute train ride on the Canada Line from Bridgeport Station
  * 15 minute walk (or short bus ride) to final destination
* Transit from city center to the airport was astonishingly quick and easy. Just hopped on the Canada Line, straight to the airport.

# Overall thoughts

This trip across Seattle, Victoria, and Vancouver was filled with hiking, city exploration, and incredible food. Each city offered something unique, and I managed to balance fun with affordability. From Seattle's dynamic neighborhoods to Victoria's serene gardens, and finally to Vancouver's foodie spots and outdoor adventures, this trip was a memorable journey through the Pacific Northwest!

I am grateful for the real-life relationships I have formed at my last company.
