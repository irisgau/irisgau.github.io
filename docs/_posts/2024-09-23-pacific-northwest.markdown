# Seattle (5 days): Food, Friends, and Adventure

**Friday:**
* Arrival: Immediately after landing, I noticed the diversity of the people and languages I heard at the airport. It only took an easy and affordable train ride to get into the city. It was a good start!
* Dinner at [Ginger & Scallion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qcgmcxf2Dfg27Pvr6): Shortly after meeting with my friend, we went to Ginger & Scallion for hainanese chicken rice. Highly recommend!

**Saturday:**
* Dimsum at [Harbor City Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XzMyyi9RqqnMnx2R8): Classic dim sum experience, the perfect start to the day.
* REI: Bought some gear for our upcoming hike. The REI flagship store was huge and beautiful.
* Catch-up: Spent time with my former coworker and his family at an indoor kids' playground, then grabbed a quick dinner at [Café Hagen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oZLkCwTYP3EwZ3rH8).
* [Swing Dance Class](https://www.swingdancesct.com/) in Fremont: Took a fun swing dance class in Fremont in the evening.

**Sunday: Hiking Day at Mt. Rainier**
* Early Start: Left for Mt. Rainier at 6am and got there with no line
* Hike: Hiked part of the Skyline loop and returned via the Alta Vista trail, covering around 5-6 miles. The Alta Vista trail was our favorite part. Absolutely beautiful.
* Lunch: My friend packed ramen and hot water for a post-hike meal. It was so delicious but my weak spice tolerance led me to getting a chili dog at the visitor center. 10/10.
* Dinner: Had a delicious Seolleongtang (ox bone soup) at [Yi's Traditional Korean Beef Soup](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ds2mMQ3x1eib6ZRc7) to end the day.

* Morning Ferry: Enjoyed the scenic ride as I made my way to Canada.

# Victoria (2 days): Gardens, Museums, and City Charm

**Wednesday: Arrival in Victoria**
* Immigration: A bit of a negative encounter with the officer who managed to man-splain to me the "dangers" of staying in a hostel and questioned how I could financially sustain this trip if I was unemployed, but I made it through.
* Uber to Hostel: Chose Uber over the bus after the officier instilled in me I was going to "the most dangerous part of the city", but had a lovely driver who assured me I was fine.
* Explored the area: Checked out thrift shops around Ocean Island Hostel and snagged some good fines.
* Walk to Inner Harbour: Strolled through the scenic inner harbor and stopped by the Legislative Assembly.
* Beacon Hill Park & Chinatown: Took in the greenery and the charm of Victoria’s Chinatown.
* Hostel Dinner & Conversations: Enjoyed a meal at the hostel and had an insightful chat with Owen, a fellow traveler from Calgary, who’s passionate about city planning.

**Thursday: A Full Day in Victoria**
* Butchart Gardens: A highlight of the trip—absolutely stunning.
* Royal BC Museum: The security guard, Sam from Venezuela, gave me a personal tour of his favorite parts of the Old Town exhibit.
* Evening Vibes: Caught live music, had poutine from a food truck, and walked around the downtown area, taking in the sights and lights of the Legislative Building.

**Friday: Goodbye Victoria**
* Morning: Grabbed a yummy sandwich near the hostel before catching the 70 bus. Not the most comfortable ride with luggage, but it worked.
* Ferry Ride: Off to Vancouver!
