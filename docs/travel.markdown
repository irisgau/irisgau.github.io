I have quite a poor memory when it comes to travel, which feels especially unfortunate since exploring new places is something I truly love. I've been fortunate enough to visit many places in my lifetime. To capture those experiences, Iâ€™ve started writing travel blogs. Not only does it help me preserve those memories, but if it can inspire or help others in planning their own adventures, all the better.

<ul class="post-list">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% if post.categories contains "travel" %}
      <li>
        {%- assign date_format = site.minima.date_format | default: "%b %-d, %Y" -%}
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: date_format }}</span>
        <h3>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}">
            {{ post.title | escape }}
          </a>
        </h3>
        {%- if site.show_excerpts -%}
          {{ post.excerpt }}
        {%- endif -%}
      </li>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
