ðŸ‘‹ My name is Iris!

I find joy in solo travel, swing dance, and a good laugh. 

I find peace in cooking, walking, and fostering cats. 

I'm a former software engineer on the search for meaning within and beyond work.

I find it wild that you're here reading this!

I'm building this site using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's a work in progress, but please poke around!
